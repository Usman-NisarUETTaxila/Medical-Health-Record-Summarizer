# UI Navigation Improvements

## Overview
Added back button navigation to all pages and implemented proper state management to clear uploaded files when navigating back through the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Back Button Navigation

**Location:** `gradio/ui/clinic-intellect-main/src/pages/Index.tsx`

#### New Navigation Functions
- **`goBackToInput()`** - Returns to input page and clears patient data, AI summary, and uploaded file
- **`goBackToHome()`** - Returns to home page and clears all form data including uploaded file
- **Updated `resetWorkflow()`** - Now also clears uploaded file state

#### Back Buttons Added To:

1. **Input Page** - Back button to return to Home page
   - Clears all input data when navigating back
   - Positioned at top-left of the page

2. **Processing Page** - Back button to return to Input page
   - Allows user to cancel processing and modify input
   - Clears uploaded file state

3. **Results Page** - Back button to return to Input page
   - Allows user to analyze different data
   - Clears uploaded file and previous results

### 2. File State Management

**Problem Solved:** Previously, uploaded files remained in memory when navigating back, causing confusion and potential memory issues.

**Solution:** 
- Added `setUploadedFile(null)` to all navigation functions
- File state is cleared when:
  - Navigating back from Input page to Home
  - Navigating back from Processing page to Input
  - Navigating back from Results page to Input
  - Using the Home button in header
  - Resetting the workflow

### 3. UI/UX Improvements

- **Consistent Design:** All back buttons use the same styling with `ArrowLeft` icon
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Back buttons positioned at top-left, separate from main content
- **Responsive:** Buttons work on all screen sizes
- **Accessible:** Clear labels and hover states

## Technical Details

### Import Changes
```typescript
import { ArrowLeft } from "lucide-react";
```

### Component Props Updates
- `InputPage` now accepts `onBack` prop
- `ProcessingPage` now accepts `onBack` prop  
- `ResultsPage` now accepts `onBack` prop

### State Management Flow
```
Home Page
    ↓ (Start Analysis)
Input Page [Back → Home, clears: patientId, textInput, uploadedFile]
    ↓ (Fetch/Generate)
Processing Page [Back → Input, clears: patientData, aiSummary, uploadedFile]
    ↓ (Complete)
Results Page [Back → Input, clears: patientData, aiSummary, uploadedFile]
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience:** Users can easily navigate back without losing context
2. **Memory Efficiency:** Uploaded files are properly cleared from memory
3. **Cleaner State:** No stale data persists when navigating between pages
4. **Intuitive Navigation:** Standard back button pattern familiar to users
5. **Error Recovery:** Users can go back and fix input errors easily

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload Flow Test:**
   - Upload a file on Input page
   - Click Back button
   - Verify file is cleared from state
   - Re-enter Input page and verify no file is shown

2. **Navigation Test:**
   - Test all back buttons on each page
   - Verify correct page transitions
   - Verify state is properly cleared

3. **Multiple Upload Test:**
   - Upload file → Back → Upload different file
   - Verify only the latest file is tracked
   - Verify old file is not kept in memory

4. **Home Button Test:**
   - Navigate through all pages
   - Click Home button from any page
   - Verify all state is reset
